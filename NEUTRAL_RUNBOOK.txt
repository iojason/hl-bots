Neutral pack for market-aware single-sided quoting (no per-coin bias enabled).

What’s included
- fast_trading.json with:
  • single_sided_mode: auto
  • market-aware filters (spread floor excess, maker-share check, side bias via decayed maker fills)
  • flip cooldown 150 loops (~30s at 200ms)
  • neutral bias defaults (bias_enabled true but no per-coin bias_side set)
  • bailout policy: partial at 30 bps after 90s underwater, full at 60 bps or 180s underwater
  • tighter cancel/replace cadence (min_replace_ms 15 global; BTC 10, DOGE 15)

How to keep it “like the wallet” but neutral
- By default, the bot will only ever quote one side at a time per coin (single-sided auto).
- It will rest only when spreads are favorable and maker share is healthy.
- It won’t enforce direction per coin until you set per-coin bias in config.

When you want to lock direction per coin
- Add per-coin keys under per_coin.<COIN>:
  • "bias_side": "long" | "short"
  • "target_inventory_usd": (e.g., 10000)
  • Optional: "inv_band_pct": 0.2–0.3

Bailout overview
- Partial reduce (33%) with IOC once MAE > 30 bps and you've been underwater >= 90s.
- Full exit at MAE > 60 bps or underwater >= 180s; then pause quoting.
- Spreads tight or maker-share weak => auto pause (no-quote) until conditions recover.

Smoke test (suggested)
1) Testnet, run for 60–120 minutes.
2) Watch logs for 'ss_market_aware', 'single_sided_flip', and fills.
3) Verify only one side is resting per coin at any moment.
4) Confirm 'N' (no-quote) kicks in when spreads are tight.

Scaling note
- Start small. Increase per-coin caps only once maker share and net PnL are stable.
